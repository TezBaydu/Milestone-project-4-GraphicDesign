### To Do

- Ensure to debug to False



### Notes to consider
- Message in GitPod stating Python extension loading and is constant. Info found in Slack and Gitpod community advising of installing an older version. Had changed from pymongo 3.12.0 to 3.5.1 but the Python extension loading message still appeared and I was unable to run app.py so have changed back to 3.12.0.
    * requirements.txt python pymongo version is 3.5.1 but this had been changed and saved as 3.12.0...unsure what has happened here but could be cause why heroku is not loading.
- Search: "[dict]" elements in app.py removed as mongoDB had applied double Arrays causing confusion between create and Edit - is good now
- ^[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,30}$ changed to ^[a-zA-Z0-9 -]{1,30}$ to accept spaces and dashes
- Login forgot password - This would be a nice to have but is not necessary for this project
- All Recipes: limit of cards but not enough time but is a nice to have
- Heroku maximum slug size is 500MB
    * Removing Gifs and going with images instead
- Input Type = "number" can be an issue with patterns especially with other formats. JS updated with a Jquery logic to help and input types changes to "text"
    * This query encountered it's own issues as it would require updating every elemenet with it's own ID, however this would also need to be done through the javascript when a new row is added and I don't have enough time to investigate this further.
        * By having input as type=number values cannot be saved and error displays on submit
